## STAGE 2 - Unleashing Your Wings
**Stage 2 is all about developing the skills you need to move on to more advanced techniques.** If you skip any of these parts, you will struggle with future stages and more advanced training.

Think about it like this, before you learn multiplication you first need to learn what numbers are. Before you learn algebra, you first need to learn multiplication. Before you learn calculus you first need to learn algebra, etc. If you are trying to learn advanced math, but are making silly mistakes with simple algebra or other lower skills, you will not be able to develop advanced skills.

 After completing Stage 2 you should have developed solid muscle memory that will help you fly with high accuracy. You will be fast. You will be smooth. You will hit aerials you never thought you could.

### Part 1 - FLYING FACING FORWARD
###### Estimated time to completion: 1 day (will be adjusted based on your feedback)
#### Learn to Fly While Facing Forward (camera is at back of car)
This is a warm up for the rest of the Stage. Make sure to complete it before moving forward.

Finish levels 1-10 while **ONLY FACING FORWARD** if your car rotates, make adjustments using Air Roll to face your car as close to facing perfectly forward as possible. Doing this will also train your Air Roll muscle memory. **MAKE SURE TO RE-ADJUST YOUR CAR WITH AIR ROLL. THIS IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS TRAINING*.

**Completion Challenge:**   
Do this until you can complete levels 1-10 without a **single reset**. If you touch the ground or walls and **RESET** you must **START FROM LEVEL 1**. 

**Do not move to the next training until you have perfected this.** YOU NEED TO FOCUS ON THIS ONE THING.

### Part 2 - FLYING FACING BACKWARDS
###### Estimated time to completion: 3 days (will be adjusted based on your feedback)
#### Learn to Fly While Facing Backwards (camera is facing the bottom of the car)
Now it will get a little bit more challenging. This is because, if you're not used to flying backwards, and you don't have the muscle memory, you simply won't be able to do this consistently.

### Part 5 - COMBINING ALL 4 SIDES - 360 DEGREE CONTROL
###### Estimated time to completion: 1 week (will be adjusted based on your feedback)
#### 360 DEGREE FLYING
In this training you will combine all 4 sides into one training. This training was developed by Kevpert and I have personally used it (Kirfy) to develop my flying. After doing the previous 4 parts this will now connect all of those skills together into **TRUE 360 DEGREE CAR CONTROL** in the air.

#### Training:
***Watch:***

https://youtu.be/eHc90uGBW3Ihttps://youtu.be/ed8owajA0Lc?t=161

***Do:***  
Practice the training in 30-120min sessions before/after playing ranked or whenever you feel like it.
**DO NOT USE AIR ROLL FOR THIS PART.**

**Completion Challenge:**   
To complete this training, you should be able to fly around the ball without touching the ground or making any mistakes. You should feel that it is easy and can complete a single rotation around the ball without really thinking that much. **COMPLETE 5 BACK TO BACK ROTATIONS AROUND THE BALL WITHOUT ANY MISTAKES, HESITATION, OR TOUCHING THE GROUND**

**Bonus Challenge:**
Try doing it far away from the ball (larger rotation) and as close to the ball as possible.

**Do not move to the next training until you have perfected this.** YOU NEED TO FOCUS ON THIS ONE THING.
