## Note to Trainees using this guide:
Hey guys! Here's the training guide as promised. However I need to clarify a few things...  

 **This is a work in progress.** I **need** your help to improve it. I need your feedback, your thoughts, etc. If you think it sucks, great! Let me know so we can fix that! If you have suggestions, again let me know where it needs improvement. Together we'll make it the most effective Rocket League training there is.

Anyway, reach out to me if you need any help, or anything at all!

### ** IMPORTANT - FEEDBACK REQUEST - HELP IMPROVE THIS TRAINING **
For those of you who want to help develop this training I kindly ask that you provide some quick feedback after you complete each part of the training. This feedback is extremely valuable as it will help adjust the training to make it more effective, and fix any mistakes.

Please provide:
1. Your Rank when you are attempting each training, in 1v1s and 2v2s.
2. How long it took you to complete the completion challenge after you started the training.
3. If you've noticed improvement in game play in your games after the training.
4. Anything you think should be changed in the training, or if something else could have been better.

Post them to the **#training** text channel on discord (join here https://discord.gg/fCeKeRp) in this format:

- **Training Stage:** (1,2,3...)
- **Training Part:** (1,2,3...)
- **Training Name:** (Kickoffs, basic dribbling, etc.)
- **Rank 2v2:** (Bronze 1 -Champ 3 etc.)
- **Rank 1v1:** (Bronze 1 -Champ 3 etc.)
- **Days to complete:** (1-30)
- **Extra Notes:** notes....

## Step 1. Configure correct settings.
### ALL (PS4, PC, XBOX):
Note: These settings are to give beginners a good place to start building muscle memory. Diamond 2 and Above can ignore or use their preferences.
- Change dodge deadzone to (RECOMMENDED) 0.55 *(optional)*
- Change controller deadzone to 0.03-0.015 *(only set it once, never change it again)*
- Use this visualizer to see what your deadzone looks like https://halfwaydead.gitlab.io/rl-deadzone/
- Turn off cam shake
- Turn off controller vibration
- Set camera settings to something one of the pros use. (pick one you like, then never change it) https://prosettings.net/rocket-league-pro-camera-settings-controller-list/
- Keep sensitivity at 1.0 for everything. **(don't change this unless you're a champ+)**

### PC Graphics:
- Make sure you get at least 70+ FPS. Lower the quality settings if you have to.
- You need at least 1080p quality

### PS4 - XBOX:
- Turn off vertical sync. *(EXTREMELY IMPORTANT)*
- Turn off weather effects.
- Turn off light shafts

**Now you have settings that are similar to what high level players use. These are important.**

## Step 2. Controller settings. (optional, highly recommended)
### (PS4 controller)
- Boost: R1
- Air Roll: L1 *(only useable while in air)*
- Power slide: L1 *(only useable while on ground)*
- Jump: X 
- Switch camera: Triangle

Everything else is up to you, but these are the most important as they control your car the most. Using these settings will make it easier to control the car as each action has a dedicated finger. It may be hard to use at first, but it will only take you ~10 games to get used to.

## Step 3. Training.

This is a list of car control training that you must complete in order. I will be using youtube videos, training packs, or workshop levels. You must master them before moving to the next one.
You will notice that most of the goal scoring aerial training is in the later stages, this is because you must first train to simply control the car before moving to goal scoring. Doing the aerial training will be much easier if you first train to simply control the car without a ball involved which adds much more complexity.

### Rules for training:
1. **Complete all training in order.** **No exceptions**. **All ranks must start at the beginning**.
2.  You can move on to any training as long as you complete the **Completion Challenge** for each. If you don't complete the completion challenge, you need to do more training.
3. Do not move to the next training until you can do each training with *extreme ease* and *absolutely no failures*. You must **aim for the stars** when doing this training. Meaning that you must absolutely master it before moving to the next one as these training's are cumulative. Before moving to the next training you should be able to complete the previous training with no thinking effort, **it should feel like your fingers are moving on their own, and that you can complete it without really thinking**.
4. **You cannot stop training sessions unless you see slight improvement. Otherwise you just wasted your time.** Meaning, that if you do the training for 30 minutes and you see no improvement, you must keep doing it and not stop until you see improvement, even if it's a very slight or very small improvement. Don't lie to yourself. You'll know if you've improved or not.
5. For this entire training program, you must focus on just ONE THING at a time. Whether it be kickoffs, aerials, dribbling, anything. There will be absolutely no parallel training (or training multi-tasking) as you will only see mediocre improvement in each. This program requires that you master each training one by one.

I know that these rules may seem harsh, but they will produce the most results. **Not following these rules will just waste your time and effort.**
